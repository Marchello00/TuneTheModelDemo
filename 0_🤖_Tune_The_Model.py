# Text: Classical economics states that money constitutes of four chief functions: medium, measure, standards and store. Money used in this form eliminates the inefficiencies associated with the traditional barter system, for instance double coincidence of wants. In this context, money can be viewed as a unit that is used to measure the worth of deferred payment. From this perspective, money as a unit of account is a key requirement during the making of agreements that entail debt or future payments.

# Text: Ginger is native to Southern Asia and was later cultivated in Ancient China as a food source and medicine. Over time, ginger cultivation spread to India, from there it was carried to the Middle East as part of the spice trade. As crusaders returned home to Europe from the Middle East, they brought spices with them, including cinnamon, pepper and ginger.
